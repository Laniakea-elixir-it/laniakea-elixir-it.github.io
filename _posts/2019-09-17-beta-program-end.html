<p>The Laniakea closed beta program is officially closing in the next few days to move on to the production phase.</p>
Laniakea will be soon again available together with a novel and more user friendly interface and reworked encryption system.
Laniakea 2.0 introduces a novel and strongly configurable web interface that facilitates a more straightforward customisation of the user experience and a reworked encryption procedure that exploits Hashicorp Vault as encryption keys management system.
