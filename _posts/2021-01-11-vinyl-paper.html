<p>
VINYL (Variant PrIoritizatioN by survivaL analysis) is a bioinformatics workflow for the functional annotation and prioritization of genetics variants in clinical studies.

VINYL is implemented as a collection of Perl and R scripts composed by 3 main modules: the optimizer, which computes the best scoring system; the threshold, which optimizer derives the optimal score cut off and the score calculator, which computes the pathogenicity score by integrating different types of annotation.

<p>
VINYL is distributed as <a href="http://www.beaconlab.it/VINYL/" target="_blank">Galaxy Public server</a>  developed on Laniakea or it is available through Laniakea to deploy a personal server.
