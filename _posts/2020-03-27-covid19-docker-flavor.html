<p>
A Galaxy Covid-19 flavour is now available in Laniakea, as Docker Container. It is based on the <a href="https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/genomics" target="_blank">GalaxyProject covid-19 analysis</a> and it is continuously updated.
</p>
<p>
Due to the current Covid-19 outbreak, the flavour is made available to Laniakea users without the usual test routine. Users are welcome to deploy it and report any issue. We will continue its development in the following days.
