<p>
CorGAT is a collection of tools to align complete assemblies of SARS-CoV-2 genomes with the reference genomic sequence, to obtain a list of polymorphic positions and to  annotate the genetic variants.
Functional annotation files incorporated in CorGAT are updated on a monthly basis, to cope with the constant increase in publicly available data and genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2. 
</p>

<p>
CorGAT is distributed as <a href="http://corgat.cloud.ba.infn.it/galaxy" target="_blank">Galaxy Public server</a>  developed on Laniakea or it is available through Laniakea to deploy a personal server.
