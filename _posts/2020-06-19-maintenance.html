<p>Dear Users,</p>

<p>
due to some issues with CentOS NGINX repository, it is not possible to deploy Galaxy Live build (both cluster and single VMs), currently. Live builds will be temporarily unavailable.
<br>
We are working hard to fix the problem.
Thanks a lot for your understanding.
</p>

<p>The Laniakea team.</p>
