<p>Dear Users,</p>

<p>
the Laniakea CoVaCS CVMFS, providing Galaxy reference data for CoVaCS instances, needs to be rebuilded.
The repository will be off-line during this procedure. If you are using this repository or encounters problems using Reference Datasets, please contact us. We will help you to fix it.

We apologize for the discomfort.
Kind regards,
</p>

<p>The Laniakea team.</p>
