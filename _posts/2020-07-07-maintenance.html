<p>Dear Users,</p>

<p>
the IAM authentication service, used by Laniakea, will be unavailable on thursday 09/07/2020, from 09:30 to 10:30 CET, due to scheduled maintenance. Consequently, Laniakea will not be available during the same time slot.
We will let you know as soon as the service will be up and running again.
The maintenance will not affect deployed instances.
We apologize for the discomfort.
Kind regards,
</p>

<p>The Laniakea team.</p>
