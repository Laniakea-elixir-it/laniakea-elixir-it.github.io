<p>
The Galaxy Covid-19 flavour have been updated with new tools and workflows. It is available in Laniakea, as Docker Container, and it is based on the <a href="https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/genomics" target="_blank">GalaxyProject covid-19 analysis</a>.
</p>
<p>
Due to the current Covid-19 outbreak, the flavour is made available to Laniakea users without the usual test routine. Users are welcome to deploy it and <a href="https://github.com/Laniakea-elixir-it/laniakea/issues" target="_blank">report any issue</a>. We will continue its development in the following days. 
</p>
