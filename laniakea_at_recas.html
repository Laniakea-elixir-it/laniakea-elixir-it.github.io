ELIXIR-ITA and ReCaS-Bari are pleased to announce that applications are now open for our pilot “ELIXIR-ITA Laniakea@ReCaS” Call, starting on 10 February 2020.
</p>

<p>
The ELIXIR-ITALY Laniakea@ReCaS Call offers access to Cloud resources to be used for the deployment of on-demand Galaxy instances, ready for production, with reference data and tools already pre-configured and ready to be used. Users of the service will be able to configure, launch, and manage their Galaxy instance(s) on the Cloud using a user-friendly interface. 
</p>

<p>
A scientific and technical evaluation board appointed by ELIXIR-ITA will assess the scientific soundness and technical feasibility of applications. Projects will be evaluated with a “first come, first served” policy until the total available resource annual budget will be assigned. 
</p>

<p>The open call is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13xAslyusLwbAxyl3Yef58NgEYI5-BoKQ/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
